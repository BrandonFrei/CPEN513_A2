# CPEN513_A2
Simulated Annealing


Brandon Freiberger, 86799228


To run this, run the command "python3 annealing.py". The input file can be changed on line 331.

The program will print the current acceptance rate as well as the temperature each iteration to the command line. It will also plot
the temperature and the current cost. 

The plot will pause for 10 seconds after the last iteration, then the window will close.

To run the program without range windows, comment out lines 381-384, and uncomment lines 373-376. Unfortunately, ifdef statements are
not as easy to work with as they are in C :(
